While in an advanced cryptography class a classmate proposed an encryption scheme which was, in part, based on Cellular Automata. The idea was og great interest to me, and thus I took it upon myself to perform a light cryptanalysis of his proposed scheme, as well as a more general investiagtion into CA's and their uses for encryption. That cryptanalysis can be found here. 

It should be noted however, that due to lack of time I was unable to fully investigate certain questions of interest which are noted at the end of the paper. In the future, I may investigate these questions. 

I did not create or contribute to the creation of the original Talos Cipher and I make no claims as such. If the curious reader would like to speak with the person who did create the cipher, I would be more than happy to put them in contact as requested.
