abstract="One-way hash functions are an important tool in achieving authentication and data integrity. The aim of this paper is to propose a novel one-way hash function based on cellular automata whose cryptographic properties have been extensively studied over the past decade or so. Furthermore, security of the proposed one-way hash function is analyzed by the use of very recently published results on applications of cellular automata in cryptography. The analysis indicates that the one-way hash function is secure against all known attacks. An important feature of the proposed one-way hash function is that it is especially suitable for compact and fast implementation in hardware, which is particularly attractive to emerging security applications that employ smart cards, such as digital identification cards and electronic cash payment protocols,",

abstract = {In this article, we develop the basic theory of digital topological groups. The basic definitions directly lead to two separate types, based on the details of the continuity required of the group multiplication. We define NP1- and NP2-digital topological groups, and investigate their properties and algebraic structure. The NP2-type is very restrictive, and we give a complete classification of NP2-digital topological groups. We also give many examples of NP1-digital topological groups. We define digital topological group homomorphisms, and describe the digital counterpart of the first isomorphism theorem.}
